##What?

The goal of this project is to create a webapp with guild-based tools for [ArcheAge](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC4QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.archeagegame.com%2F&ei=YGYAVeG3BPeTsQSUoIDwDw&usg=AFQjCNHgURxtVBi1FIL_jHHfsMNRRnfGbQ&sig2=Gny2Vis_vOgGhYs9L9QP_A).  The projected features of the finished include:

1. User Page
	>> This page allows users to create and maintain a set of characters and their professions.  Also integrates with properties pages.
2. Members Page
	>> This page lists all characters in the guild by their onwner user, so any user of the page can easily identify who's alt is who's, and what level each character in the guild has attained in each proficiency.
3. My Properties Page
	>> This page allows you to add and remove properties you own in the game, subsequently adding timers for tax due dates, complete with warnings and "pay taxes" function.
4. Property Info Page
	>> This page is generated via the "info" button on each property on the Properties Page, or by clicking on a property from the All Properties page, and allows any guild member to add packs to any property owned by another guild member.  These changes are then reflected on both Properties pages.
5. All Properties Page
	>> This page lists all properties by character and owner user, which allows users to see and interact with packs that are on guild member properties.
6. Guild Bank
	>> This page indicates how much gold is currently in the guild bank, with likelyhood of adding a log to record bank transactions.  Transaction access limited to special user group.
7. Auction House Listing
	>> This page offers a simple method for tracking the cost of individual items on the auction house.
